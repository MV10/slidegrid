# slidegrid

A simple multi-monitor or tiled-window slideshow program for events or parties.

Features:
* Up to 10 display areas, either full-screen or defined regions
* Automatic or manual advance
* Synchronized or staggered auto advance
* Highlight list shown more often, or exclusively
* Multiple randomization options

The Content list is always required. The Highlight list is optional.

Saved files are plain-text and can be edited outside the application. (Saving a file also generates explanatory comments in the file.)

Keys to control the presentation are shown on the playlist setup window. The mouse left/right buttons and the mouse wheel can also be used to advance a given display area.

All features are working except the various fill options and network file support. Currently, all images are zoomed to their display region with correct aspect ratio. Network support is coming soon.

The program supports JPG, PNG, GIF, and BMP files because Windows GDI handles these natively. Even though I'm not personally a fan of the WEBP format, I will probably add this at some point.

Pull-requests are welcome.
